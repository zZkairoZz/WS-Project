        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>I'm Jay Lord B. Abansado, a 20-year-old IT student. Residing right now in an apartment at Ubujan Distrrict, Tagbilaran City.</p>
        <p> I love trying to code something new despite the pressure. Just like how i learned the basics of CSS and finishing this project for a day. Was a stressful yet fun challenge to do.</p> 
        <p></p>I am an active and sporty person despite my exhausted look. A really addicted music listener</p>
        <p>I do love learning other languages (For now it's Korean and Japanese). Somewhat loving literature?... I do love writing, reading poems and love reading asian comics, but hates writing and reading long texts...</p>
        <p>And of course, just the only child of a proud and humble family.</p>
