        <h2>My History: Why I Became an IT Student</h2>
        <p>My journey into IT began in high school when I first tinkered with a broken computer my family had. Fixing it sparked a curiosity about how technology works behind the scenes. I was fascinated by how code could create entire worlds in video games or solve real-world problems like automating tasks.</p>
        <p>As I explored more, I realized IT wasn't just about fixing gadgets, it's about innovation and shaping the future. Influenced by tech giants like Google and the rise of AI, I decided to pursue a degree in Information Technology. It combines my love for problem-solving with the excitement of building digital solutions. Today, I'm passionate about cybersecurity and somehow interested in a stock market broker, always learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.</p>
        <p>Despite from all the pressure that I went through this journey of mine in this program. My friends has always been accompanying me through the ups and downs of my IT journey, making me push even harder.</p>
        <p>This path has taught me resilience, creativity, and the importance of continuous learning. If you're considering IT, remember: it's not just a career—it's a way to make a difference.</p>
